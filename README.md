# Parse state from URL Slug

This is a very basic version.

Improvements that can be made:

- Parsing the type of the values correctly (all string currently)
- Either/Or kind of categories(if exact_model present discard company)
- Rebuild the url for consistency and discard unused and extra parameters
- Parsing algorithm may be improved
- Available options object can be restructured to be more efficient and support more features
- Support multiple values for a single category
